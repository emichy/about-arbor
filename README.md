This repository exists to anchor my public GitHub profile.

Most of my real work lives in **private repositories**, including:

## Lisnloop
**AI-powered customer discovery for product engineers**  
https://lisnloop.com  

A modern product-listening platform that helps engineering teams run better customer interviews, extract insights, and make sharper product decisions.

## Client Work
I lead product workd across multiple private codebases for venture-backed SaaS companies.

If you’re evaluating my work, see the **Pinned Repositories** on my GitHub profile — they show what I’m actively building and shipping.
